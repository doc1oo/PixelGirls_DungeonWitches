  Gamma correction error summary
  
  The printed value is the maximum error in the pixel values
  calculated by the libpng gamma correction code.  The error
  is calculated as the difference between the output pixel
  value (always an integer) and the ideal value from the
  libpng specification (typically not an integer).
  
  Expect this value to be less than .5 for 8 bit formats,
  less than 1 for formats with fewer than 8 bits and a small
  number (typically less than 5) for the 16 bit formats.
  For performance reasons the value for 16 bit formats
  increases when the image file includes an sBIT chunk.
  
  Basic gamma correction:
    8 bit gray:  0.49933
    8 bit color: 0.49933
    indexed:     0.00000
   16 bit gray:  0.74080
   16 bit color: 0.74080
  
  Gamma correction with sBIT:
   16 bit gray:  0.74058
   16 bit color: 0.74058
  
  Gamma correction with 16 to 8 bit reduction:
   16 bit gray:  1.97052
   16 bit color: 1.97052
  
  Gamma correction with background:
    8 bit gray:  3.71044
    8 bit color: 17.66429
   16 bit gray:  1.87968
   16 bit color: 100.32108
  
  Gamma correction with alpha mode:
    8 bit gray:  17.48251
    8 bit color: 17.48251
   16 bit gray:  309.24044
   16 bit color: 310.97330
