Changes since the last public release (1.6.13):
  Guard usage of png_ptr->options with #ifdef PNG_SET_OPTION_SUPPORTED.
  Do not build contrib/tools/pngfix.c when PNG_SETJMP_NOT_SUPPORTED,
    to allow "make" to complete without setjmp support (bug report by
    Claudio Fontana)
  Add "#include <setjmp.h>" to contrib/tools/pngfix.c (John Bowler)
  Use nanosleep() instead of usleep() in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c
    because usleep() is deprecated.
  Define usleep() in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c if not already defined
    in unistd.h and nanosleep() is not available; fixes error introduced
    in libpng-1.6.13.
  Define FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, and FE_OVERFLOW in pngvalid.c if not
    already defined (bug report by "zootus at users.sourceforge.net").
  Fixed incorrect handling of the iTXt compression flag in pngrutil.c
    (bug report by Shunsaku Hirata).  Bug was introduced in libpng-1.6.0.
  Added "option READ_iCCP enables READ_COMPRESSED_TEXT" to pnglibconf.dfa
  Removed unused "text_len" parameter from private function png_write_zTXt().
  Conditionally compile some code in png_deflate_claim(), when
    PNG_WARNINGS_SUPPORTED and PNG_ERROR_TEXT_SUPPORTED are disabled.
  Replaced repeated code in pngpread.c with PNG_PUSH_SAVE_BUFFER_IF_FULL.
  Added "chunk iTXt enables TEXT" and "chunk zTXt enables TEXT"
    to pnglibconf.dfa.
  Removed "option READ_COMPRESSED_TEXT enables READ_TEXT" from pnglibconf.dfa,
    to make it possible to configure a libpng that supports iCCP but not TEXT.
  Removed "option WRITE_COMPRESSED_TEXT enables WRITE_TEXT" from pnglibconf.dfa
  Only mark text chunks as written after successfully writing them.
  Fixed some typos in comments.
  Changed png_convert_to_rfc_1123() to png_convert_to_rfc_1123_buffer()
    in the manual, to reflect the change made in libpng-1.6.0.
  Updated README file to explain that direct access to the png_struct
    and info_struct members has not been permitted since libpng-1.5.0.
